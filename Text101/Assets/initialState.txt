You stretch in the chill morning air and yawn. Above you, hints of pink peek through the canopy where you can just make out the dawnlight-painted sky. 

You glance at the cave mouth in the rock wall behind you where you spent the night.

What do you do?
1. Time to get moving. Investigate the area.
2. You're still sleepy. Go back into the cave.
