You stretch in the chill morning air and yawn. Above you, hints of pink peek through the canopy where you can just make out the dawnlight-painted sky. 

Behind you, the mouth of the cave where you spent the night is barely noticeable in the foliage.

What do you do?
1. Time to get moving. Investigate the area.
2. You're still sleepy. Go back into the cave.
