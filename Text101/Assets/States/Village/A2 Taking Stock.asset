  storyText: All around you are dense, deciduous trees. A breeze sighs lightly through
    the leaves. Fist-sized rocks litter the ground around you. Tangled undergrowth
    makes passage through the forest difficult. To the west are some leafy plants,
    low to the ground. To the north you spy a clearing.
  optionText: Investigate the area around the cave
